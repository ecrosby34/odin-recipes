# Odin-Recipes

This is my first project in an effort to display my html knowledge as I continue progressing. I will have demonstrated skill growth in general git knowledge, html structure, images and their src, links and their href, and more general html attributes. 
 
This site will list a recipe and all of its ingredients required to make the dish with images and links to each recipe involved.

I will be coming back to this project at a later date with improved knowledge of CSS and Javascript. 1/14/24
