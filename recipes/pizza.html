        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Margherita Pizza is a classic Italian pizza known for its simplicity and high-quality ingredients. It's named after Queen Margherita of Italy and is said to represent the colors of the Italian flag with its red tomato sauce, white mozzarella cheese, and green basil leaves. Here's a description of the components:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>

            <p><li><strong>Pizza Dough:</strong> The base of Margherita Pizza is a thin and chewy pizza dough. The dough is typically made with basic ingredients like flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil. It's rolled out into a round shape to form the crust.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Tomato Sauce:</strong> The tomato sauce used for Margherita Pizza is simple and fresh. It's often made with high-quality tomatoes, crushed or pureed, and seasoned with salt and sometimes a touch of olive oil. The sauce should be applied sparingly, allowing the flavors of the tomatoes to shine.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Mozzarella Cheese:</strong> Fresh mozzarella cheese is a key element of Margherita Pizza. It's typically sliced and spread over the tomato sauce. The use of fresh mozzarella adds a creamy texture and mild flavor to the pizza. Some variations may use buffalo mozzarella for an even more authentic touch.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Basil Leaves:</strong> Fresh basil leaves are scattered on top of the pizza after baking. The aromatic and slightly sweet flavor of basil complements the tomatoes and mozzarella, providing a burst of freshness to each bite.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil is often added to the pizza just before or after baking. This not only enhances the flavors but also contributes to the overall richness of the dish.</li></p>

        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>The pizza is traditionally cooked in a wood-fired pizza oven, which imparts a characteristic smokiness and crispiness to the crust. However, it can also be baked in a conventional oven at high temperatures.</p>

        <p>Margherita Pizza is celebrated for its purity and emphasis on quality ingredients. It has become a symbol of traditional Italian pizza, and its timeless combination of flavors continues to be enjoyed worldwide.</p>

        <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Pizza Dough:</strong></li>
            <p>
                <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Mix until the dough comes together. Knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong></li></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach (usually around 475-500°F or 245-260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven during preheating.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong></li></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it in half (or as needed).</li>
                <li>On a floured surface, roll out each portion of dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong></li></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                <li>Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza peel or a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle minced garlic over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Arrange slices of fresh mozzarella evenly on top.</li>
                <li>Add fresh basil leaves.</li>
                <li>Drizzle olive oil over the pizza and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong></li></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, place it directly in the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><li><strong>Serve:</strong></li></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </ol>
