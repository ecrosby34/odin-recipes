        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef Tapsilog is a popular Filipino dish that combines three main components: <strong>beef (tapa)</strong>, <strong>garlic-fried rice (sinangag)</strong>, and <strong>fried egg (itlog)</strong>. The name "Tapsilog" is a portmanteau of the three main elements. Here's a breakdown of each component:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>

            <p><li><strong>Beef Tapa (Tapa):</strong> Thinly sliced beef marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, calamansi (Filipino lime), garlic, sugar, and sometimes vinegar. The beef is typically cured or marinated to achieve a flavorful and slightly sweet taste.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Garlic-Fried Rice (Sinangag):</strong> Cooked rice stir-fried with minced garlic until golden brown. This adds a fragrant and savory element to the dish.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Fried Egg (Itlog):</strong> A sunny-side-up or over-easy fried egg is served on top of the beef and rice. The runny yolk adds richness to the overall flavor.</li></p>

        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Tapsilog is often enjoyed as a hearty breakfast or brunch option, and it's a popular choice in many Filipino eateries known as "tapsihan" or "silog" places. The term "silog" is derived from the combination of "sinangag" (garlic-fried rice) and "itlog" (egg), which are common components in various Filipino breakfast dishes. The dish is beloved for its savory, sweet, and satisfying flavor profile.</p>
